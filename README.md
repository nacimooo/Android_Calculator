# Why Make It?
This is just my first attempt at making an app of any kind, so I wanted to keep it simple, although there are many things that I did not see coming, but I guess that is the fun of it


# How To Run The App:
Download the zip file and decompress it, then open it in android studio, after that, you should be able to run it in the android emulator
